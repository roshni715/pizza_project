# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel + SQL)

This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis of a fictional pizza restaurant using Microsoft Excel and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).The goal was to extract insights from sales data, perform SQL-based data exploration, and build an interactive Excel dashboard to support business decisions.

## 📌 Objective

  - Pivot Tables
  - Slicers
  - Charts (Bar, Line, Pie)
  - Conditional Formatting
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
  - Data querying and filtering
  - Grouping and aggregation (e.g., total revenue, order count)
